Support for building White Lightning Forth Programs on PC, as described in 

This program takes a snapshot of a white lightning environment ( i.e. from an emulator running white lightning  ) 
and lets you extend or integorate the Forth dictionary. Optionally, you can also supply forth source code which will be compiled and
used to extend the dictionary. Typing "PROG" will save a new image which can then be loaded into an emulator ( or a real spectrum, in theory ... ) for testing. Typing "ZAP" will build a standalone snapshot which will run from the last word defined in the Forth dictionary. More details on White Lightning can be found here
